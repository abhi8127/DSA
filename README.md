# DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. It is organized into different branches, and I am actively working on the ***DSA-Must-Do-Question branch***, where I have pushed several solutions.

## Branches

* **main** : Default branch for general updates.
* **master** : Legacy branch, currently inactive.
* **DSA-Must-Do-Question** : Active branch where I am pushing code for essential DSA problems.

## Problems Solved (in DSA-Must-Do-Question branch)

1. Check for Prime Number: Determines if a given number is prime.
2. Check for Anagram: Verifies if two strings are anagrams.
3. Check for Palindrome: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
4. FizzBuzz: Classic problem to print numbers with specific conditions.
5. 

### For detailed solutions, switch to the **DSA-Must-Do-Question** branch.
