# DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

This repository contains solutions to key Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. It is organized into different branches, and I am actively working on the **DSA-Must-Do-Question** branch, where I have pushed several solutions.

## Branches
- **main**: Default branch for general updates.
- **master**: Legacy branch, currently inactive.
- **[DSA-Must-Do-Question]([#dsa-must-do-question](https://github.com/abhi8127/DSA/tree/DSA-Must-Do-Question))**: Active branch where I am pushing code for essential DSA problems.

## Problems Solved (in DSA-Must-Do-Question branch)
- **Check for Prime Number**: Determines if a given number is prime.
- **Check for Anagram**: Verifies if two strings are anagrams.
- **Check for Palindrome**: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
- **FizzBuzz**: Classic problem to print numbers with specific conditions.

For detailed solutions, switch to the **DSA-Must-Do-Question** branch.
