# DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

This repository contains solutions to key Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. It is organized into different branches, and I am actively working on the **DSA-Must-Do-Question** branch, where I have pushed several solutions.

## Branches
- **main**: Default branch for general updates.
- **master**: Legacy branch, currently inactive.
- **[DSA-Must-Do-Question](https://github.com/abhi8127/DSA/tree/DSA-Must-Do-Question)**: Active branch where I am pushing code for essential DSA problems.

## Problems Solved (in DSA-Must-Do-Question branch)
- **Check for Prime Number**
- **Check for Anagram**
- **Check for Palindrome**
- **FizzBuzz**

For detailed solutions, switch to the **DSA-Must-Do-Question** branch.
